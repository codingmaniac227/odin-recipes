2. Using basic HTML tags and elements
3. Linking between multiple HTML pages
4. Incorporating images into web pages
5. Creating ordered and unordered lists
6. Writing proper HTML boilerplate

## Reflection

This project has been an excellent opportunity to apply the HTML concepts learned in the initial part of the curriculum. It has reinforced my understanding of HTML structure and elements, and has given me practical experience in creating a multi-page website.

I am eager to continue with my learning, and will move on to understanding the fundamentals behind CSS next in order to come back to this project with a few more skills under my belt to stylize my website.
